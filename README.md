## Large Group Projects
🛜 WiScan: 
- Partnered with a 6-member team to design and build a Raspberry Pi–powered device integrated with a fully functional Android app; project awarded **1st place in the 2024 Mini Capstone Competition**.  
- Engineered a network security geo-scanner that maps WiFi networks, identifies vulnerabilities, and provides insights by collecting and analyzing BSSID, security protocols, provider information, and geolocation data.  
- Implemented Android Studio features including an interactive triangulation-based map, CSV-exportable scan lists, real-time statistics dashboards, and remote hardware control (safe shutdown, settings).

🔧 Autonomous Hovercraft:
- Designed and built a fully autonomous hovercraft (dual fan lift + thrust) capable of traversing a competition track and overcoming obstacles using IR and IMU sensor fusion with PID stabilization.  
- Implemented modular C++ APIs and classes (IR sensor, IMU, navigation, motors, UART/USB) with low-level register configuration and PID control, ensuring robust sensor integration and real-time error correction.  
- Conducted Matlab and CoppeliaSim simulations to optimize weight distribution, component layout, and movement algorithms before fabrication.  
- Applied additive manufacturing (3D printing in PETG/TPU) to develop a lightweight frame, custom brackets, and fan pressure sleeves, improving lift by 300g and enhancing stability.  
- Managed the project with Agile methodology, dividing responsibilities across mechanical, software, and simulation teams; completed within 11 weeks under competition constraints and budget.
