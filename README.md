## Large Group Projects
🔧 Autonomous Hovercraft:
- Designed and built a fully autonomous hovercraft (dual fan lift + thrust) capable of traversing a competition track and overcoming obstacles using IR and IMU sensor fusion with PID stabilization.  
- Implemented modular C++ APIs and classes (IR sensor, IMU, navigation, motors, UART/USB) with low-level register configuration and PID control, ensuring robust sensor integration and real-time error correction.  
- Conducted Matlab and CoppeliaSim simulations to optimize weight distribution, component layout, and movement algorithms before fabrication.  
- Applied additive manufacturing (3D printing in PETG/TPU) to develop a lightweight frame, custom brackets, and fan pressure sleeves, improving lift by 300g and enhancing stability.  
- Managed the project with Agile methodology, dividing responsibilities across mechanical, software, and simulation teams; completed within 11 weeks under competition constraints and budget.
